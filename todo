Private Cloud Roadmap:
    1. Set up microvm.nix with a mkMicrovm function. Provide a NixOS configuration and exposed ports and it automatically sets it up on the host system.
    2. Finish writing jdns. The recursive resolver will support custom zone files & service records.
    3. Write a STUN server to allow NAT hole punching. Now wireguard configuration does not require an endpoint.
    4. Use `jdns` with service records for querying the IP;port (see: https://www.jordanwhited.com/posts/wireguard-endpoint-discovery-nat-traversal/ )
    5. Orchestration of microvms?
