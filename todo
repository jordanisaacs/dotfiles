[x] done, [-] in progress, [ ] todo, [!] Broken

Flake Refactors:
    [-] flake.nix should only contain configuration.
    [-] Switch to submodules to make nested options work better.
    [ ] Refactor builder function to take global configuration
        [ ] With the increased use of my private cloud need to reference other system configs.
            Make every machine get passed into the module and have which machine config you want to build
        [ ] Remove the builder function custom parameters and make them part of module system

Overall: 
    [ ] Systemd service hardening
        - https://bertptrs.nl/2021/09/05/securely-passing-secrets-to-dynamicuser-systemd-services.html
    [!] DynamicUser=yes and reading files for systemd - breaks syncthing services
        - Switch to dynamic users with systemd credentials
